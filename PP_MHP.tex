\section{Introduction}
In recent years, permissionless cryptocurrencies, have emerged as a novel means to facilitate secure
and reliable payments within a decentralized framework, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. 
These cryptocurrencies employ a consensus mechanism to verify each transaction, which is
then recorded on a publicly distributed ledger known as blockchain. Unfortunately, 
the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies is hidered by notable scalability chanllenges. Complex consensus mechanisms, like Bitcoin's Proof-of-work(PoW), 
and the limited block size of the blockchain contribute to the issue. The theoretical
throughput of Bitcoin stands at approximately 10 transactions per second(TPS), with a transaction confirmation time of 
around 1 hour. In contrast, traditional decentralized payment networks, 
such as Visa, boast the capability up to 47,000 TPS. Furthermore, the presence of high transaction fees renders small-value 
payments impractical for cryptocurrency users.

One promising solution proposed to tackle the issue of scalability is the implements of payment channels(PCs).
PCs are off-chain payment protocols that enable two parties, who have established a channel,to conduct quick and
validated transaction off-chain. To elaborate, the overrall process can be divided into three phases. Firstly, 
during the channel-openning phase, both users commit a portion of their coins to a shared address as
initial funds, which is executed on-chain. In the subsequent channel-updating phase, the involved parties have
the flexibility to engage in numerous off-chain transactions. They can adjust the allocation of funds between themselves
by generating and exchanging signed transaction message. Ultimately, when the participants opt to settle the 
channel or encounter a dispute, they initiate the closing process by broadcasting the latest signed transaction
to the blockchain. This transaction represents the most up-to-date distribution of funds within the channel.

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English.
